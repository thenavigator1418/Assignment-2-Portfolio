An assignment to produce a responsive personal portfolio with HTML and CSS.

## Installation
The project website is available on my current GitHub Pages link. To access and install project files, download the ZIP and unpack with software like WinRAR, or clone it directly to your machine. Or, visit the URL directly here: https://thenavigator1418.github.io/Assignment-2-Portfolio.


## Usage
<a href="https://ibb.co/LQ22Yrc"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VHPPJxz/Portfolio2.jpg" alt="Portfolio2" border="0"></a>

As this is a regular website, usage of the actual website should be very straightforward. Please note the screenshot of this portfolio will auto-delete after two weeks. If you need a new one, please let me know.
